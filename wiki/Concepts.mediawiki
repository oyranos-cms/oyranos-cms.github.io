'''Concepts''' which shall help ensuring interoperability, ease of interaction or meet other goals. They should serve the end to end expectations of users. Pros and Cons can be discussed here.

== Diversity ==
To bring various users and producers together the ICC[http://www.color.org] standard was created. This standard covers a data format to exchange colour information of devices.

== Precision ==
The OpenEXR CTL[http://www.openexr.com/documentation.html] approach to use direct colour formulas in GPU shader programs is an try to increase precision and speed related to the demands of the film industry [http://www.ilm.com].

== Consistency ==

Editing spaces are a very valuable concept to achieve good results during compositing and manipulating images.
* colour channels should by equally editing the exposure, behave equally regarding saturation (no turning of gray into green)

== Flat color vs. mixed mode documents ==

One concept of the ICC-standard, is the possibility to create documents, where every object (image, vector graphics, text-objects) can have is own profile and rendering intent. This makes color management of complete documents very complex and can easily results to unwanted color transformations of individual objects of an document.

To give users successful experiences with color management, it is useful to have the option of an color management policy, which allows only the creation of flat color documents in well known and tested editing spaces.

== Stages of manipulation ==

Handling of colour data is been expected in several states, handled by dedicated colour spaces. The following describes a process with three steps.

* know data (tagged with profile or machine readable description), unknown or uncertain data -> assign a assumed source profile (distinguish RGB/CMYK)
* editing colour space to tweak and manipulate, mostly with enough colour volume
* output or proofing colour space, considered as a destination for the final content. This colour space can be used to check against during editing and possibly convert as the last stage of editing.

== Untagged data ==

Most difficult is here the mixed behaviour of applications regarding tagging versus non tagging of exchange data with colour profiles.

=== Assign an profile into untagged data ===

A simple example is a photographer, which is aware of tagging images correctly and delivers them to his customer. Next step is to include such tagged photo into an document in an CM unaware word processor. The output from the word processor is prepared as pdf for the web and as pdf for printing. As the word processor is ignoring any colour profiles it is up to the system to follow a rule, which makes the colour data unambiguous.

*leave it as is for viewing, and interpret as follows below
**pros:
***signal that untagged data are unknown
**cons:
***ambiguous across platforms
*attach only during modifications - maybe convert to an default colour space (is policy dependent)

=== Interpretation of untagged data ===
*always sRGB, the [[Standards#sRGB_workflow|WWW]] standard colour space
**pros:
***mostly unambiguous
**cons:
***sRGB is limited regarding saturation
*always osX standard RGB ??
*always Adobe RGB(1998) ??
*take data as in monitor colour space - a traditional point of view used up to date
*differentiate between input path for colour data:
**WWW sites -> sRGB
**Files from outside of the computer -> selectable profile
**Files from inside the computer -> selectable profile
As the source of images, whether they come from out- or inside the computer, becomes more and more fuzzy, this concept is difficult to implement.

=== Save onto an untaggable image format ===
*warn user about losing colour space information during saving

== Policies ==
=== Average User ===
Most people belong to the [[What_the_users_want#Office_Users_.2F_Webdesigners|Office User type]]. They need an reliable conversion behaviour. Simplicity is the main goal there. [[Standards|sRGB]] serves this behaviour well. Defaults should be set to:
* assumed RGB - sRGB
* editing colour space: sRGB
* convert always data to editing space (before a save, not nice, but the most reliable in mixed CM aware environments)
* don't prefer mixed colour space documents (keep it simple)

=== Graphics Distribution ===
[[What_the_users_want#Graphic_Designers|Graphic Designers]] and other specialist may want to use own settings. Here some defaults:
* assumed RGB - sRGB or Adobe(?)
* no pop-up for untagged images
* editing RGB - Adobe,ECI or L-Star (large gamut)
* convert RGB data during editing to editing space (don't pop up dialogs)
* no pop-up for conversion
* don't convert CMYK data (because of possibly failed black preserving capabilities)
* allow mixed colour space documents (warning for internet PDF's?)

== Device Settings ==
The device to device colour path contains as well the settings to receive and to output colours. This makes the storage of these settings necessary for a working colour management. Currently such settings are spread over various places. They are partially stored in application and OS databases or only partially embedded in profiles, like the vcgt tag. There should be a format developed and used, which makes it easy to combine both colour and settings characterisation.

[[Device Settings]]

== User Interface ==
=== Profile Selection ===
* use a flat directory to store all files
** easy to read by all applications
** needs several mechanisms to distinguish profiles for devices, editing ...
* use directories hierarchically
** allow all kind of distinguishing even if not supported by Oyranos, other may use nevertheless
** easy grouping of device, editing ... profiles
** needs a layout and specification

== Manipulation ==
The goal of using manipulations is to get an good image correction for special cameras, media or special scenes. The process is as well known in the film industry as colour grading.

Manipulations exist as profiles of ICC type abstract profiles. They are use by CinePaint or Photoshop for instance. On OS X they are part of the color management system ColorSync. Therefore I would think at least the ICC profile version could be included in Oyranos.

Curves today used by CinePaint, Gimp and UFRaw are originally proprierity ones delivered with Nikon and other software. People translated them to use in these programs. The format is basically a response curve telling which intensities should come out for an given value. These curve files can contain single curves or curves for multiple channels, like Value, R,G,B, Alpha + ?

Not shure for the curves. Maybe they can be converted to abstract profiles. Gutenprint handles an own curves format for print settings. It is XML-based and Robert Krawitz calls them piecewise curves.

One interesting aspect of the Gutenprint XML curves is that they are editable. For profile editors an approximation algorithm is needed. An edited profile can as been more easily written as CLUT but would probably loose precision during conversion from an matrix based one.
