'''Concepts''' which shall help ensuring interoperatibility, ease of interaction or met other goals. They should serve the end to end expectations of users. Pros and Cons can be discussed here.

== Diversity ==
To bring various users and producers together the ICC[http://www.color.org] standard was created. This standard covers a data format to exchange colour information of devices.
== Precision ==
The OpenEXR CTL[http://www.openexr.com/documentation.html] approach to use direct colour formulas in GPU shader programs is an try to increase precision and speed related to the demands of the film industry [http://www.ilm.com].
== Consistency ==
Editing spaces are a very valuable concept to achive good results during compositing and manipulating images.
* colour channels should by equally editing the exposure, behave equally regarding saturation (no turning of gray into green)
== Flatcolor vs. mixed mode documents ==
One concept of the ICC-standard, is the possibility to create documents, where every object (image, vectorgraphics, text-objects) can have is own profile and rendering intent. This makes colormanagement of complete documents very complex and can easily results to unwanted colortransformations of individual objects of an document.
To give users succesful experiences with colormanagement, it is useful to have the option of an colormanagement policy, which allows only the creation of flatcolor documents in well known and tested editing spaces.
== Untaged data ==
Most difficult is here the mixed behaviour of applications regarding tagging versus non tagging of exchange data with colour profiles.
=== Assign an profile into untagged data ===
A simple example is a photographer, which is aware of tagging images correctly and delivers them to his customer. Next step is to include such tagged photo into an document in an CM unaware word processor. The output from the word processor is prepared as pdf for the web and as pdf for printing. As the word processor is ignoring any colour profiles it is up to the system to follow a rule, which makes the colour data unambiguous.

*leave it as is for viewing, and interprete as follows below
**pos:
***signal that untagged data are unknown
**cons:
***ambiguous across platforms
*attach only during modifications - maybe convert to an default colour space (is policy dependent)
=== Interpretation of untagged data ===
*allways sRGB, the [[Standards#sRGB_workflow|WWW]] standard colour space
**pros:
***mostly unambiguous
**cons:
***sRGB is limited regarding saturation
*allways osX standard RGB ??
*allways Adobe RGB(1998) ??
*take data as in monitor colour space - a traditional point of view used up to date
*differenciate between input path for colour data:
**WWW sites -> sRGB
**Files from outside of the computer -> selectable profile
**Files from inside the computer -> selectable profile
As the source of images, wether they come from out- or inside the computer, becomes more and more fuzzy, this concept is difficult to implement.
=== Save onto an untaggable image format ===
*warn user about losing colour space information during saving
