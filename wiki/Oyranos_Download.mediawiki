==== Dependencies ====

Oyranos depends on following libraries and external applications:

* libxml2
* FLTK version <= 1.1.4 neede to build the GUI (needed by FLU as well). You may configure FLTK with several options enabled:
    --enable-threads is needed for threads support (in ICC Examin)
    --enable-xft is ok for antialiased fonts
    --enable-debug is generally a good choice
    --enable-shared is sometimes a good choice for smaller executables
* Elektra, this is the configuration system used under linux.
Optionally:
* ICC Examin is the profile viewer of Oyranos' configuration GUI. It provides a view on profile internals and a gamut view. It uses littleCMS and Oyranos.
* Xcalib for loading a given VideoCardGammaTag from profile to a running XFree86/Xorg session (optionally)
* Cairo
