==== Dependencies ====

Oyranos depends on following libraries and external applications:

* libxml2
* FLTK version <= 1.1.4 neede to build the GUI (needed by FLU as well). You may configure FLTK with several options enabled:
    --enable-threads is needed for threads support (in ICC Examin)
    --enable-xft is ok for antialiased fonts
    --enable-debug is generally a good choice
    --enable-shared is sometimes a good choice for smaller executables
* Elektra, this is the configuration system used under linux.
Optionally:
* [[ICC Examin/Download|ICC Examin]] is the profile viewer of Oyranos' configuration GUI. It provides a view on profile internals and a gamut view. It uses littleCMS and Oyranos.
* Xcalib for loading a given VideoCardGammaTag from profile to a running XFree86/Xorg session (optionally)
* Cairo

==== Compile Instructions ====

For building unpack the tgz file and type #configure; make; make install.
Optionally you can specifiy an other than the default prefix /opt/local by typing:

    configure --prefix=/what/you/like
    make
    make install       # (optionally)

    configure --help   # will show details
    make help          # shows the available targets

Detailed build instructions are as well included in the packages.

==== openSUSE build server ====
'''''bekun''''' YUM repositories for:

http://www.oyranos.org/images/fedora-logo.png<br>
[https://www.oyranos.org/wiki/images/b/b0/Bekun-Fedora_10.rpm f-10]
* 12
* 13

[https://www.oyranos.org/wiki/images/a/a7/Bekun-openSUSE_10.3.rpm openSUSE-10.3] 
[https://www.oyranos.org/wiki/images/0/02/Bekun-openSUSE_11.0.rpm openSUSE-11.0]
* 11.2


After installing one of the above setup RPM's the  '''''bekun''''' repository is activated in yum.
For a full installation install the icc_examin package:
 yum install icc_examin
Yum should resolve all dependcies. The ''icc_examin-cinepaint'' package is for a more indepth colour space exploration inside [[CinePaint|Cin√©Paint]].

In case a missed libelektra.so.2 message is shown, as can happen on Fedora, try first the following command:
 yum erase elektra
and repeat the above ''icc_examin'' or ''icc_examin-cinepaint'' installation.
