==== Dependencies ====

Oyranos depends on following libraries and external applications:

* libxml2
* FLTK version <= 1.1.4 neede to build the GUI. You may configure FLTK with several options enabled:
    --enable-threads is needed for threads support (in ICC Examin)
    --enable-xft is ok for antialiased fonts
    --enable-debug is generally a good choice
    --enable-shared is sometimes a good choice for smaller executables
* Elektra, this is the configuration system used under linux.
Optionally:
* [[ICC Examin/Download|ICC Examin]] is the profile viewer of Oyranos' configuration GUI. It provides a view on profile internals and a gamut view. It uses littleCMS and Oyranos.
* Xcalib for loading a given VideoCardGammaTag from profile to a running XFree86/Xorg session (optionally)
* Cairo
* Compiz
* CUPS
* libraw


==== Compile Instructions ====

For building unpack the tgz file and type #configure; make; make install.
Optionally you can specifiy an other than the default prefix /opt/local by typing:

    configure --prefix=/what/you/like
    make
    make install       # (optionally)

    configure --help   # will show details
    make help          # shows the available targets

Yum should resolve all dependcies. The ''icc_examin-cinepaint'' package is for a more indepth colour space exploration inside [[CinePaint|Cin√©Paint]].
