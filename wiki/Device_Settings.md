This includes:

-   device settings (as provided, colour relevant ones should be queried
    automatically)
-   changeable driver settings
-   colour characterisation (a ICC profile belonging to the above
    settings)

advantages:

-   select an profile and the system knows about needed settings
-   change settings and the system can tell if an profile is available
-   email a complete settings file, no further information is needed to
    setup
-   use the same settings in all applications, they are globally
    available

Tasks (X example, similiar to print, scan, digicams):

-   obtain monitor settings informations
-   set/reset monitor settings from software (xcalib/ddccontrol,...)
-   interface to get/set settings from Oyranos to drivers
-   extract ICC information easily

TODO: Move this part to an own page, check for available options (ICC,
XML...), choose, implement in [Oyranos](/wiki/Oyranos "wikilink")
