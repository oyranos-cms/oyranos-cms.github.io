**Welcome on the ColourWiki site!**

just starting ...

This site is intended for a collection of information regarding Open
Source[1](http://www.opensource.org) [Colour
Management](colour_management "wikilink"). This includes technical
proposals, extractions from [email](/wiki/OpenICC "wikilink") or IRC
discussions, articels and related links. Take it as drawing board as
well as for publishing ideas.

One goal is to create a documentation for the open source Colour
Management System [Oyranos](/wiki/Oyranos "wikilink"). This includes the
concept, a description, feature wish lists, in the future tutorials and
links to related sites.
