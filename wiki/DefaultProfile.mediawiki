enum oyDEFAULT_PROFILE

Enumeration values:
    oyEDITING_RGB 	Rgb Editing (Workspace) Profile
    oyEDITING_CMYK 	Cmyk Editing (Workspace) Profile
    oyASSUMED_XYZ 	standard XYZ assumed source profile
    oyASSUMED_LAB 	standard Lab assumed source profile
    oyASSUMED_RGB 	standard RGB assumed source profile
    oyASSUMED_CMYK 	standard Cmyk assumed source profile
    oyDEFAULT_PROFILE_TYPES 	just for easen Gui design

* Jan-Peter Homann and Chris Murphy voted to hide Lab and XYZ. If there is no practical usage, I, Kai-Uwe, will remove them.



*older tasks:
** done (As discussed on OpenICC INPUT should change to something like UNTAGED.)
** done (WORKSPACE should become EDITING (Chris Murphy))
** done (Jan-Peter Homann requested an differenciation between Cmyk and Rgb Editing colour space.)
** done (I would change the name of Input INPUT_CMYK to EDITING CMYK (Jan-Peter))
