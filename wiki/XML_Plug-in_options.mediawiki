Simple Toolkit Abstraction is the name of a project idea on the GSoC2008 OpenICC page. Its goal is to provide a simple way for plug-ins and CMM's to describe options and have some slightly control over its presentation layout. Jon A. Cruz gave some helpful suggestions on what to focus on this area. The dataflow could be something like this:
 XFORMS + XML -> xslt -> toolkit XML -> native toolkit widgets

Requirements:
* based on W3C technology (Xforms, Dom ...)
* callback mechanism (possibly to pass the changed serialised widget layout, like a diff, to the callback)
** can a XEvents subset be supported?
* callback as C function or CTL for portability?
* easy separation of layout (widgets) from data (options)
** should work fairly good with XForms
* widget set: tabs, groups, lists, choice list, sliders (range), buttons, check button, radio button, text box, drawing area
** screenshots / forms selection
*** currently I am exploring processors:
*** firefox 2.0.0.6 with XForms.xpi-v0.84 does not
*** [http://www.orbeon.com Orbeon] looks nice but seems rather big
* define orientation (horizontal/vertical for grouping inside a pack style widget)
** some definitions are in oyranos_alpha.h -- oyWidget_s ... but may become obsolete with XForms
* select one widget per group for scaling; place this widget at top, bottom, right, left, centered or to fill as specified
** CSS (subset) as prefereed by XForms?
* serialise and deserialise from and to XML/XForms
* support console applications
* converters for at least Qt, Gtk, FLTK ...
