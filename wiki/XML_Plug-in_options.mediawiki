Simple Toolkit Abstraction is the name of a project idea on the GSoC2008 OpenICC page. Its goal is to provide a simple way for plug-ins and CMM's to describe options and have some slightly control over its presentation layout. Jon A. Cruz gave some helpful suggestions on what to focus on this area. 

== Architecture ==
The dataflow could be something like this:
 XFORMS + XML -> xslt -> toolkit XML -> native toolkit widgets

XForms and HTML elements need to be supported fo the UI definition. The idea is to have as less layout code there as possible and let the UI engine decide how to display. The plug-ins should be able to expose the grouping of their options, their type and icons, labels and so on. To automate processing, the standard options need to be specified on Oyranos side.

What is all involved?
* user categories (filter categories ...)
* Oyranos backend API's mapping (CMM need images, profiles and options, filters want images + options?)
* UI backend deploy xslt conversions to their xml UI representation
* event exchange

== Requirements ==
* based on W3C technology (Xforms, Dom ...)
* ajax based technology ((X)HTML, CSS and Javascript)
* callback mechanism (possibly to pass the changed serialised widget layout, like a diff, to the callback)
* callback as C function or CTL for portability?
* easy separation of layout (widgets) from data (options)
** should work fairly good with XForms
* widget set: tabs, groups, lists, choice list, sliders (range), buttons, check button, radio button, text box, drawing area
** there shouldnt be a problem using interactive and non-inetactive widgets using AJAX technology
** screenshots / forms selection
*** currently I am exploring processors:
*** firefox 2.0.0.13 with XForms-v0.8.5 does with a xforms.xhtml (not *.html)
*** [http://www.orbeon.com Orbeon] looks nice but seems rather big and needs a local tomcat compilation
* define orientation (horizontal/vertical for grouping inside a pack style widget)
** some definitions are in oyranos_alpha.h -- oyWidget_s ... but may become obsolete with XForms
* select one widget per group for scaling; place this widget at top, bottom, right, left, centered or to fill as specified
* serialise and deserialise from and to XML/XForms
* support console applications
* converters for at least Qt, Gtk, FLTK ...
* XML data models will be made by using XML_Schema (W3C).
