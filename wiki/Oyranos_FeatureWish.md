### Feature Wishes for [Oyranos](/wiki/Oyranos "wikilink")

They come mostly from discussions at the [OpenICC](/wiki/OpenICC "wikilink")
email list.

-   check for validity of a display setup (calibrated: yes/no, expired,
    ...)

<!-- -->

-   check for well behaving of Editing colour spaces (Matrix, Rgb: gamma
    equally over all channels, Gray achsis, ...)

<!-- -->

-   use of standard folders for: display profiles, RGB-editing profiles,
    CMYK-editing profiles.

If advanced users want to use special profiles e.g. for editing, they
have manually to add the profile to this folder. This is an easy way to
implement a solution, that beginners are not able to choose wrong
profiles by accident.

-   colormanagement policies

- only allow flatcolor documents or allow mixed mode documents ? - how
to deal with profile mismatches during opening files ? - how to deal
with profile mismatches during placing content ?
