Even most questions are answered on the [http://www.oyranos.org Oyranos] site already, here is the FAQ.

If you have the impression an important question is missed, feel free to add it.


=== What is Oyranos? ===
The Oyranos project is a colour management system (CMS). It is intended to work in a comparable fashion like KCMS, ICM or ColourSync except it is published with sources and is available for various platforms.

=== What is the goal of Oyranos? ===
Oyranos tries to provide colour management services for applications and services like Scribus, CinePaint, Krita, Gimp, Inkscape, Gutenprint, UFraw, Cups, Xorg, Sane and so on. 

With colour management being a often complicated pattern, the need rises to easily understand what goes on behind the scenes. Doing this once is often hard enough. Having different colour settings in every application and service may easily multiply the work to relyable understand how colours get managed. Thus Oyranos is a call to collaborate between applications to make them all more attractive.

For instance all Oyranos conform applications should display colour content on the monitor in the same manner, equally if the user has set soft proofing on by default in the Oyranos configuration panel or not.

=== Where comes the name Oyranos from? ===
Oyranos is the greek word of sky.

It was pointed out that ouranos is more adequate for english readers. Just as with the german Uranos and other variants it seems pretty good to stay with the name.

=== License(s) ===
Oyranos is licensed under new BSD. It is possible that parts will be released under different licenses. But that is open. The goal is to not exclude anyone from using Oyranos.

=== Where can I get Oyranos? ===
Oyranos is officially published on [http://www.behrmann.name/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=34&Itemid=68 Kai-Uwe's site]

=== Who is developing Oyranos? ===
Currently Oyranos is a one man project of [http://www.behrmann.name Kai-Uwe Behrmann]. I see myself as a photographer, who came in the situation of creating its own imaging workflow through the lack of adequate GUI's on the Linux OS. Still I am searching for [[#How_can_I_help_with_the_Oyranos_CMS.3F|help]].

=== How can I help with the Oyranos CMS? ===
You could help by testing, reporting bugs or providing according patches, doing translations, as well as suggesting useful changes or, if we all feel well with it, become part of the development team.

We need people with fantasy for going possibly new paths, meticulousness for assuring quality, analytical, didactic and aesthetic skills and thinking around the corner or all together. Some knowledge or feeling of colour may be of help. But this is not a must, as uneducated persons bring in a very important view.

See as well [http://www.oyranos.org/#devel].

=== Which applications use Oyranos? ===
A list of Oyranos users is [http://www.oyranos.org/#audience here].

A list of Linux/BSD relevant colour managed applications can be found [http://www.oyranos.org/wiki/index.php?title=Applications here].

=== Can Oyranos replace other Colour management Systems? ===
This is not intentional. Each colour management system has its strengths not easily reachable by an other. If your application runs just on osX it is possibly best to stay with the advanced features of ColourSync. Is your intention to run your application on different platforms such as Windows, osX and the various unixes, Oyranos may be of much value, as it will provide a single API allowing real cross platform development. Oyranos tries to use as many as possible of the underlying colour management services, as long as it conforms to its cross platform behaviour. 

Naturally advanced features will be unlikely to get supported as they are not cross platform, and would have to been accessed directly.
