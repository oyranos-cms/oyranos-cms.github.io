gnome-color-manager

Pros:

-   well integrated into Gnome desktop
-   provides profiling of several devices through ArgyllCMS in a nice UI

Contras:

-   does not share its configuration across desktops, more workload for
    applications
-   no policy concept in software from the author of the policykit,
    people are in need to configure each option separately
-   the program exposes wrong terms, confusing diagrams and false
    claims, so it is very confusing to its audience
-   very fat solution as it offers profiling as well, that part should
    better be split out
