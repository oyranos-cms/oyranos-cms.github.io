== Feature Wishes for [[Oyranos]] ==
They come often from discussions at the [[OpenICC]] email list. It is a good place to annotate, suggest, or ask. Writing here is better than forget elsewhere.

=== Devices ===
* implement [[Device_Settings]] in ICC profiles
* generalise to Sane, CUPS ... see as well [[Device_Settings#Specific_Considerations|here]]
* integrate into the [http://code.google.com/soc/2008/openicc/appinfo.html?csaid=9EFC0E521D25020 KDE Kolormanager] mentored by [[OpenICC]] developers

==== Monitor ====
* check for validity of a display setup (calibrated: yes/no, expired, ...)
* add non EDID monitor support - by a mix of X description and by Xinerama geometry (prepared for 0.1.8)

* common screen naming sheme for X11, osX and Windows
* [[#Named Colours|Named Colours]] in X11, osX ,Windows representation
* clear about VCGT handling, use Xcalib (licensing?) or ArgyllCMS, give at least a hint at configure time "found Xcalib/Argyll - can load VCGT"
* support the upcomming [http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/OpenIcc/ColorManagementNearX X11 CM protokolls] developed by Tomas Carnecky.
* XRandR support

=== ICC profile handling ===
* check for well behaving of Editing colour spaces (Matrix, RGB: gamma equally over all channels, Gray axis, ...)
* check ICC profiles

|}

* extraction of colorimetric informations from a profile like primaries, gamma or profile type

=== Settings and Policies ===
* use of standard folders for: display profiles, RGB editing profiles, CMYK editing profiles.
If advanced users want to use special profiles e.g. for editing, they have manually to add the profile to this folder. This is an easy way to implement a solution, that beginners are not able to choose wrong profiles by accident.

* color management policies

** done (only allow flat color documents or allow mixed mode documents ?)
** done (how to deal with profile mismatches during opening files ?)
** done (how to deal with profile mismatches during placing content ?)
*to add:
** done (add CMYK editing profile (OY_DEFAULT_EDITING_CMYK_PROFILE))
** done (add non-editable web colour space sRGB for displaying - should be used during download from web (OY_DEFAULT_WEB_PROFILE=sRGB))
** done (profile assigning for untagged data during opening (auto / leave / ask) (OY_UNTAGGED_ASSIGN_ACTION))
** done (add RGB/CMYK opening mismatch policy (convert / leave attached profile/pop-up) , in an pure sRGB environment it could be used to make all unknown RGB content equal (OY_MISMATCH_RGB_OPEN_ACTION ...))
** done (profile assigning for mismatched data during editing policy, harmonise during editing for homogeneous colour space documents (OY_MISMATCH_CMYK_CHANGE_ACTION ...))
** note: placing and editing files could equal react regarding mismatch (handles the mismatch question from above)
** mixed colour space documents for internet warning/quiet (OY_MIXED_COLOUR_INTERNET_DOCUMENT_WARNING)

* rendering intent (Craig Ringer's suggestion)
** Perceptual
** Relative Colorimetric with BPC
** -- Rarely Needed --
** Relative Colorimetric without BPC
** Absolute Colorimetric
** Saturation

* allow non persistent settings, examples:
** useful for temporarily adding profile paths in osX bundles
** switching default profiles to gamma 1.0 versions in one application, without touching other applications

==== Directory Paths ====

* (done) update Oyranos' internal path representation to the [[OpenIccDirectoryProposal|OpenICC Directory Proposal]]
* (done) OY_MODULE_PATHS for CMM's

=== Standard Profiles ===
* naming of ECI profiles to something FOGRA corresponding (Chris Murphy and others on OpenICC)
* most ECI profiles are replaced with Argyll created ones
* remains to relicense or replace the eciRGB ones

* done - channel names list
* done - colour name
* done - colour description
* done - colour nick name

* done (show in headers only stable functions)
* done (remove unstable functions from descriptions)

* later show only advanced options to those users who like it
** something like default settings / policy
** and modify policy, advanced or custom

* publicate Colori
* IPC

== Todo ==
[[Oyranos]] Roadmap
=== Target 1.0.0 ===
* see [http://www.oyranos.org/doc/html/concept_1.0.html inline] documentation


=== Target 0.1.8 ===
* (done) error handling 
* (done) information callback function:
  int (*callback)(int code, const char* format, ...)
** internally all can stay with macros
** the context should remain distinguishable, as over a pointer or a ID, the anonymous callback design above is problematic for OO programming
* override default settings, dependent whether they are inbuild or explicitely set by a user [http://www.behrmann.name/wind/cinepaint/cinepaint_2007.04.13_1.html]: delayed until options are inside a oyOptions_s objetc
* (done) gray profile setting
* (done) license change as [http://www.oyranos.org/#license stated]
* (done) new default profiles from [http://www.eci.org/eci/de/060_downloads.php ECI]
* (done) investigate in ColorSync ignoring some CMM:SGI marked profiles
* (done) look into newer Elektra library API (Oyranos v0.1.7 can use Elektra v0.6.4) v0.1.8 uses Elektra v0.7.x(which waits for its release)
