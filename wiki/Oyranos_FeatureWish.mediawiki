=== Feature Wishes for [[Oyranos]] ===
They come mostly from discussions at the [[OpenICC]] email list.

* check for validity of a display setup (calibrated: yes/no, expired, ...)

* check for well behaving of Editing colour spaces (Matrix, Rgb: gamma equally over all channels, Gray achsis, ...)

* use of standard folders for: display profiles, RGB-editing profiles, CMYK-editing profiles.
If advanced users want to use special profiles e.g. for editing, they have manually to add the profile to this folder. This is an easy way to implement a solution, that beginners are not able to choose wrong profiles by accident.

* colormanagement policies
** only allow flatcolor documents or allow mixed mode documents ?
** how to deal with profile mismatches during opening files ?
** how to deal with profile mismatches during placing content ?
*to add:
** add CMYK editing profile (OY_DEFAULT_EDITING_CMYK_PROFILE)
** add noneditable web colour space sRGB for displaying - should be used during download from web (OY_DEFAULT_WEB_PROFILE=sRGB)
** profile assigning for untagged data (auto / leave / ask) (OY_UNTAGGED_ASSIGN_ACTION)
** add RGB/CMYK opening mismatch policy (convert / leave attached profile / popup) , should be used to make all content equal in an pure sRGB environment (OY_MISMATCH_RGB_OPEN_ACTION)
** add RGB/CMYK editing mismatch policy, harmonice during editing for homogenous colour space documents (OY_MISMATCH_CMYK_CHANGE_ACTION)
** note: placing and editing files should equal react regarding mismatch (handles the mismatch question from above)
** mixed colour space documents for internet warning/quiet (OY_MIXED_COLOUR_INTERNET_DOCUMENT_WARNING)
