=== Feature Wishes for [[Oyranos]] ===
They come mostly from discussions at the [[OpenICC]] email list.

* check for validity of a display setup (calibrated: yes/no, expired, ...)

* check for well behaving of Editing colour spaces (Matrix, RGB: gamma equally over all channels, Gray axis, ...)

* use of standard folders for: display profiles, RGB editing profiles, CMYK editing profiles.
If advanced users want to use special profiles e.g. for editing, they have manually to add the profile to this folder. This is an easy way to implement a solution, that beginners are not able to choose wrong profiles by accident.

* color management policies
** done (only allow flat color documents or allow mixed mode documents ?)
** done (how to deal with profile mismatches during opening files ?)
** done (how to deal with profile mismatches during placing content ?)
*to add:
** done (add CMYK editing profile (OY_DEFAULT_EDITING_CMYK_PROFILE))
** done (add non-editable web colour space sRGB for displaying - should be used during download from web (OY_DEFAULT_WEB_PROFILE=sRGB))
** done (profile assigning for untagged data during opening (auto / leave / ask) (OY_UNTAGGED_ASSIGN_ACTION))
** done (add RGB/CMYK opening mismatch policy (convert / leave attached profile/pop-up) , in an pure sRGB environment it could be used to make all unknown RGB content equal (OY_MISMATCH_RGB_OPEN_ACTION ...))
** done (profile assigning for mismatched data during editing policy, harmonise during editing for homogeneous colour space documents (OY_MISMATCH_CMYK_CHANGE_ACTION ...))
** note: placing and editing files could equal react regarding mismatch (handles the mismatch question from above)
** mixed colour space documents for internet warning/quiet (OY_MIXED_COLOUR_INTERNET_DOCUMENT_WARNING)

* done (split Oyranos headers for users, configuration)
* done (show in headers only stable functions)
* done (remove unstable functions from descriptions)

* later show only advanced options to those users who like it
** something like default settings / policy
** and modify policy, advanced or custom

* done(v0.1.5) Bob Friesenhahn suggested Oyranos should be completely relocatable

* ICC_PROFILE_PATH ? how to interact with Oyranos
