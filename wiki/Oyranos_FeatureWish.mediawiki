== Feature Wishes for [[Oyranos]] ==
They come often from discussions at the [[OpenICC]] email list. It is a good place to annotate, suggest, or ask. Writing here is better than forget elsewhere.

=== Devices ===
* implement [[Device_Settings]] in ICC profiles

==== Monitor ====
* check for validity of a display setup (calibrated: yes/no, expired, ...)
* add non EDID monitor support - by a mix of X description and by Xinerama geometry (prepared for 0.1.8)

| Progress: 100% [done]

| Start: 2007.08.00

|}
* common screen naming sheme for X11, osX and Windows
* [[#Named Colours|Named Colours]] in X11, osX ,Windows representation


=== ICC profile handling ===
* check for well behaving of Editing colour spaces (Matrix, RGB: gamma equally over all channels, Gray axis, ...)
* check ICC profiles

| Progress 10%
| Version: x.x.x

|-
|}


=== Settings and Policies ===
* use of standard folders for: display profiles, RGB editing profiles, CMYK editing profiles.
If advanced users want to use special profiles e.g. for editing, they have manually to add the profile to this folder. This is an easy way to implement a solution, that beginners are not able to choose wrong profiles by accident.

* color management policies

** done (only allow flat color documents or allow mixed mode documents ?)
** done (how to deal with profile mismatches during opening files ?)
** done (how to deal with profile mismatches during placing content ?)
*to add:
** done (add CMYK editing profile (OY_DEFAULT_EDITING_CMYK_PROFILE))
** done (add non-editable web colour space sRGB for displaying - should be used during download from web (OY_DEFAULT_WEB_PROFILE=sRGB))
** done (profile assigning for untagged data during opening (auto / leave / ask) (OY_UNTAGGED_ASSIGN_ACTION))
** done (add RGB/CMYK opening mismatch policy (convert / leave attached profile/pop-up) , in an pure sRGB environment it could be used to make all unknown RGB content equal (OY_MISMATCH_RGB_OPEN_ACTION ...))
** done (profile assigning for mismatched data during editing policy, harmonise during editing for homogeneous colour space documents (OY_MISMATCH_CMYK_CHANGE_ACTION ...))
** note: placing and editing files could equal react regarding mismatch (handles the mismatch question from above)
** mixed colour space documents for internet warning/quiet (OY_MIXED_COLOUR_INTERNET_DOCUMENT_WARNING)

* allow non persistent settings, examples:
** useful for temporarily adding profile paths in osX bundles
** switching default profiles to gamma 1.0 versions in one application, without touching other applications

==== Directory Paths ====
* ICC profile path specification

* ICC_PROFILE_PATH ? how to interact with Oyranos


=== Standard Profiles ===
* naming of ECI profiles to something FOGRA corresponding (Chris Murphy and others on OpenICC)

Constitute a colour patch presentation:

* done - CIELab representation
* done - arbitrary channels (32)
* done - channel characterisation (4 byte ICC signature)
* done - channel names list
* done - colour name
* done - colour description
* done - colour nick name
* done - colour reference (ICC profile)
* done - cgats representation, this can contain additional observer characteristics or spectral data
* allow for grouping ( swatches )
* exchange as colour selection(s) in X11, Quartz ...
* Named Colours as file (xml?)
* keep in sync with [http://create.freedesktop.org/wiki/index.php?title=Swatches_-_colour_file_format Create]


=== Miscellaneous ===
* done (split Oyranos headers for users, configuration)
* done (show in headers only stable functions)
* done (remove unstable functions from descriptions)

* later show only advanced options to those users who like it
** something like default settings / policy
** and modify policy, advanced or custom

* done(v0.1.5) Bob Friesenhahn suggested Oyranos should be completely relocatable


== Todo ==
[[Oyranos]] Roadmap
=== Target 1.0.0 ===
* see [http://www.oyranos.org/doc/html/concept_1.0.html inline] documentation


=== Target 0.1.8 ===
* error handling 
* information callback function:
  int (*callback)(int code, const char* format, ...)
** internally all can stay with macros
* override default settings, dependent whether they are inbuild or explicitely set by a user [http://www.behrmann.name/wind/cinepaint/cinepaint_2007.04.13_1.html]
* gray profile setting, done for 0.1.8
* license change as [http://www.oyranos.org/#license stated]
* new default profiles from [http://www.eci.org/eci/de/060_downloads.php ECI]
