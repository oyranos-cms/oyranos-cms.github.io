=== Feature Wishes for [[Oyranos]] ===
They come mostly from discussions at the [[OpenICC]] email list.

* check for validity of a display setup (calibrated: yes/no, expired, ...)

* check for well behaving of Editing colour spaces (Matrix, Rgb: gamma equally over all channels, Gray achsis, ...)

* use of standard folders for: display profiles, RGB-editing profiles, CMYK-editing profiles.
If advanced users want to use special profiles e.g. for editing, they have manually to add the profile to this folder. This is an easy way to implement a solution, that beginners are not able to choose wrong profiles by accident.

* colormanagement policies
** done (only allow flatcolor documents or allow mixed mode documents ?)
** done (how to deal with profile mismatches during opening files ?)
** done (how to deal with profile mismatches during placing content ?)
*to add:
** done (add CMYK editing profile (OY_DEFAULT_EDITING_CMYK_PROFILE))
** done (add noneditable web colour space sRGB for displaying - should be used during download from web (OY_DEFAULT_WEB_PROFILE=sRGB))
** done (profile assigning for untagged data during opening (auto / leave / ask) (OY_UNTAGGED_ASSIGN_ACTION))
** done (add RGB/CMYK opening mismatch policy (convert / leave attached profile / popup) , in an pure sRGB environment it could be used to make all unknown Rgb content equal (OY_MISMATCH_RGB_OPEN_ACTION ...))
** done (profile assigning for mismatched data during editing policy, harmonise during editing for homogenous colour space documents (OY_MISMATCH_CMYK_CHANGE_ACTION ...))
** note: placing and editing files could equal react regarding mismatch (handles the mismatch question from above)
** mixed colour space documents for internet warning/quiet (OY_MIXED_COLOUR_INTERNET_DOCUMENT_WARNING)


* split Oyranos headers for users, configuration


* later show only advanced options to those users who like it
** something like default settings / policy
** and modify policy, advanced or custom


* Bob Friesenhahn thinks Oyranos should be completely relocateable
