* check for validity of a display setup (calibrated: yes/no, expired, ...)

* check for well behaving of Editing colour spaces (Matrix, Rgb: gamma equally over all channels, Gray achsis, ...)

If advanced users want to use special profiles e.g. for editing, they have manually to add the profile to this folder. This is an easy way to implement a solution, that beginners are not able to choose wrong profiles by accident.
