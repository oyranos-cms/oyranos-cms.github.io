Looking at the description tag is a typical option but can be faked.

Checking the resulting transform for identity in each table- and curves
entry might be an other option. The drawback is the computational cost to
create the transformation in the first place. I would expect the
device link curves to be linear[0,1] and each table output entry matching
the table input value. More pragmatically one might run the colour
conversion over a simple fine grained test image and look for differences
above a reasonable threshold. The test image should cover a reasonable
range of patches to match the DL table.

An other option, in case only two profiles are involved, is to check for
identical md5 check sums as described in the ICC profile specification.
