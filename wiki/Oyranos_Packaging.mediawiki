== Dependencies ==
For the development version check out [[Oyranos/git]] build and install.

Additional you'd need FLTK and possibly xcalib. These dependencies are mentioned here: [[Oyranos/Download]]

== Packaging ==
=== Bundling ===
Oyranos has currently no osX Framework or bundling support in its make files. Eighter use the ICC Examin bundle and look there at profiles and the files with 'oyranos' in their name. 

Or you can copy a complete installation into the bundle. The later is support by the following target in Oyranos:
 make DESTDIR="/my/home/bundle.app/Contents/Resources/" install

You have to set the XDG veriables and others to match the paths relative to the bundle to allow Oyranos to locate various data in a bundle. 

Again look at the ICC Examin bundle as an example: ICC Examin.app/Contents/MacOS/ICC Examin .

Take the lastest ICC Examin bundle, the folder ending with app, similiar named to [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=177017&package_id=247749&release_id=543945 icc_examin-x.xx_rcx.app.tgz].


A additional hint is to copy libelektra-filesys and libltdl into your bundle to satisfy Elektra. It will fix some warnings.
