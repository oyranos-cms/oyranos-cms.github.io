Talks

### Kai-Uwe Behrmann: Colour Management in Compositors

-   type: ca. 45 minutes full length presentation and discussion (will
    run in the Xorg time frame)

Xorg allows compositors to run on efficient GPU hardware. It is possibly
to deploy GPUs for low power consumption colour correction of the whole
desktop. The talk will introduce in the topic by the CompICC colour
server implementation and give a overview about used techniques and
concepts. It will try to outline next generation desktop colour
management and what is needed, from my point of view, to get colour
management well supported in graphics servers and deployed by toolkits
and applications.

### Chris Lilley: Color Management in SVG2

-   type: ca. 45 minutes full length presentation and discussion
-   abstract: SVG 1.1 is now widely implemented, and has some (minimal,
    optional) support for ICC colours. In the main though it is an sRGB
    system. SVG2 adds a conformance class for full ICC support (v2 and
    v4) including named colours, direct specification in LAB or LCHab,
    and interpolation in LAB or LCHab. Unmanaged device-specific colour
    is also supported.
-   bio: Chris Lilley is Technical Director for the Interaction Domain
    at W3C. He is involved in SVG, CSS, and Web Fonts.
