Before we talk about colormanagement policies for applications, we
should think about, what different users expect from colormanagement.

Office Users / Webdesigners
---------------------------

Such users want an easy colormanagement. They donÂ´t want to see pop-up
dialogues, that the profile of an actual file is not fitting to the
colorsettings of their application. RGB-colors should be unambigous
specified by numbers. Input, Monitor, print-output should colormatch.

Graphic Designers
-----------------

They want an easy workflow form delivered RGB-data to a CMYK-Editing
space, which represents a standard printing condition (e.G. SWOP or
ISOcoated). CMYK-colors should be unambigous specified by numbers. The
monitor should simulate the editing CMYK-Editing space. The printout
should also simulate the editing CMYK workingspace and should serve as
proof for the printinghouse. It should be easy to create PDF/X-1a data,
whith the CMYK-Editing space embedded as outputintent. They dont like
pop-up dialogues, that the profile of an actual file is not fitting to
the colorsettings of their application. They hate unwanted
colortransformtions of CMYK-data, where e.g. black or grey objects turns
to 4-color objects.

Prepress specialists
--------------------

They do more or less the same like the graphic designers, but want the
most flexible control over the colormanagement-workflow. They need
pop-up dialogues, that the profile of an actual file is not fitting to
the colorsettings of their application. They must deal with different
CMYK-Editing spaces and need control over gamutmapping strategies.

photographers
-------------

They want to use the full gamut of their camera and their inkjet
printers. Editing of pictures should be done in a workingspace, where
equal RGB-numbers result to gray.
