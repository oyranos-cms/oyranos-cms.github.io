The CMM colormatching module is the "engine" for color conversions in applications.

In Open Source applications, LittleCMS is the most used CMM. Other widely used CMMs are the AppleCMM in MacOSX, the [http://labs.adobe.com/downloads/cmm.html AdobeCMM] and the CMM delivered with Windows XP.

==== OpenGTL ====
* http://opengtl.org/ - The G of GTL means either Graphics or Generics, the T means Transformation and the L means Libraries or Languages. The C++ libraries are created by Cyrille Berger.

Currently the focus is on developing two languages, designed for two different implementations.
* OpenCTL which is a GPL compatible of the Color Transformation Language, this language is dedicated at transforming the value of a single pixel (for instance Brightness adjustement or desaturate). CTL is designed to be part of the Color Management process.
* OpenShiva is inspired by Adobe's Hydra language from the AIF Toolkit, Shiva is a language that apply a kernel-like transformations on an image, that means it works using more than one pixel.
