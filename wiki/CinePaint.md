CinePaint became its colour management during the work of Stefan Klein
at the project. It is ICC based. As an offshot the Oyranos project was
started to support interapplication conventions for colour management.
This page describes CinePaints colour management.

Investigation
-------------

-   16-bit XYZ editing and displaying
-   print dialog needs system wide colour management
-   inconsitent colour UI for the legacy Gtk1 version (channel names,
    alpha handling, partitial colour space specific dialogs)
-   automate Cineon -&gt; ICC profile selection; currently manual
-   tonemapping
-   missed floating point precision colour transforms
