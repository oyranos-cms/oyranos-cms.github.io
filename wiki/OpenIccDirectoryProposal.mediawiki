= OpenIcc Directory Proposal =

ICC profiles and characterisation data, settings and registration files need a proper place in the file hierarchy. This proposal describes common practise and new suggestions.

Each directory contains a substructure to hold different data. The naming should provide a hint what it contains.


== Scope ==
The proposal is primarily suggested for Unix alike systems, such as the BSD's and Linux.

Systems like osX and Solaris will probably provide different places or means to register ICC profiles and settings. A programming interface, like the path API's in Oyranos, should cover these specific cases.

== General OpenIcc Paths ==
The Users path should be located in:

'''''$HOME/.color'''''

Two system paths, due to different system directory layouts, exist and should be always supported:

'''''/usr/local/share/color'''''

and

'''''/usr/share/color''''' as typical for linux packages.

One application path points to:

'''''$PREFIX/share/color'''''

This paths are considered top level entry points and should contain almost no files.
Each specific data path, containing the actual data, is each located below these general OpenIcc paths.

Typical colour configuration data is architecture independent. The configuration can therefore stay in one place as further described below. 
Architecture dependent CMM modules and utilities should go into the usual file system places for libraries and binary executables.

== Colour Profile Paths ==
The colour management systems should provide various locations for storing common place colour profiles.
The directory name is

'''''icc'''''/

The directory expands then for instance to /usr/share/color/icc.
The icc subdirectory should be scanned recursively, to allow some future features.
=== Subdirectory naming rules ===
Profiles can grouped by different porpouses. Therefor some directory names are reserved for future expansion. They are mentioned below:

'editing' 'device' 'camera' 'scanner' 'monitor' 'printer' 'output' 'input' 'abstract' 'named_color_list' 'colorspace' 'file' 'standard'

The above names are not yet in use. So don't rely on them, just avoid using. You can activate easily after further discussion at the OpenIcc email list.
So a scheme like:
 /usr/share/color/icc
    vendor/
        rgb/
            vendor_rgb.icc
        cmyk/
            vendor_fogra27.icc
            vendor_fogra28.icc
            ...
would make complete sense.

== Settings ==
Settings may contain presets of single settings.
The location is at:

'''''settings'''''/


== CMMs ==
CMM's register data can be stored in:

'''''cmms'''''/


== Technical implementation ==
The profile paths exist on system level in the file hierarchy.

=== Variable ===
A variable can be specified like 

'''''OPENICC_PATH'''''

It would arguably have the advantage to fit in the above naming scheme and has OPENICC in its name to avoid conflicts. For profiles the icc/ part must be appended as mentioned in the Colour Profile Paths section. The variable contains ':' delimited values of the paths names.
