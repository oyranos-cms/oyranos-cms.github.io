CinePaint became its colour management during the work of Stefan Klein at the project. It is ICC based. As an offshot the Oyranos project was started to support interapplication conventions for colour management. This page describes CinePaints colour management.

== Features ==

* on the fly manipulation (look) profiles assignable and useable for conversion
* film playback with colour correction and effects; slow, needs further improvement
* capablility to show image colours in an 3D colour viewer including various gamuts -  [http://www.behrmann.name/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=32&Itemid=70 ICC Examin]
* littleCMS is a fixed dependency [[ColourMatchingModuls|CMM]]
* standard paths: /usr/share/color/icc;~/.color/icc + free selectable additional directories
* one proofing profile per loaded image
* ICC print separation dialog uses the proofing profile by default
* for lcms > 1.15 is Cmyk->Cmyk black preserving enabled; non selectable
* OpenEXR <-> ICC conversion roundtripping (solved with lcms on the fly profiles)
* BPC is on by default (v0.20-3)

== Investigation ==
* 16-bit XYZ editing and displaying
* print dialog needs system wide colour management
* inconsitent colour UI for the legacy Gtk1 version (channel names, alpha handling, partitial colour space specific dialogs)
* automate Cineon -> ICC profile selection; currently manual
* tonemapping
* missed floating point precision colour transforms
