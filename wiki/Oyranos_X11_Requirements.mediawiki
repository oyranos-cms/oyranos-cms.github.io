Oyranos has some requirements to provide colour management related informations through it's APIs.
For further reading see [[Monitor Configuration]].

== Architectural Overview ==

Applications need a way to communicate colorimetry of their image content. Applications, which like to handle colour management (CM) on their own, need additional a path to tell the system what to do with the content and what not.

Applications can follow several strategies:
# be dumb - The application knows nothing about CM. The system takes content as being in a default RGB colour space and does colour matching. Most applications would fall in this category.
# tag content - The application knows about the colorimetry of its content and tells the system about it.
# take over control - The application knows best how to handle its content. Tell the system to not match content with following options:
## Dont apply colour conversions. This is for proofing and image editing applications.
## Dont apply calibration from graphic card gamma tables. This is useful for HDR content.

The "take over control" kind of applications want additionally to know about the screen layout and monitor colorimetry. This is handled by Xinerama alike API's and the [[#ICC_Profiles_in_X|_ICC_PROFILE_xxx]] atom.

=== Screen Areas and Colour Space tagging ===
Two things are needed,
* a ICC profile container attached to window or screen region
* a opt out flags for colour correction down the path, so applications can handle colour management on their own
** a "no colour conversions" flag
** a "no calibration from graphic card gamma tables" flag
* the virtually thierd is that every other content is expected as sRGB, as is the case today

The above would fit along all the path:
  application -> toolkit -> composite manager -> X11 -> OpenGL -> shader.
There remains to find an endpoint where most paths meet. This could be the composite manager or a additional layer between composite manager and Xorg.

== Multi Monitor EDID in X11 ==

EDID information describes monitor parameters like description, serial number and gives hints about colourimetric behaviour. 

Oyranos uses this information to identify a particular monitor and search for a best matching profile, as long as one is stored in the Oyranos device profile database.

=== Specification ===
X servers export the EDID inormation typically in the "XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA" and "XFree86_DDC_EDID2_RAWDATA" atom. If there are more monitors connected to the root window, the following atoms get a underscore and the monitor number appended, like in 

=== Example ===
Xinerama_screen_number = 0 => XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA

Xinerama_screen_number >= 1 => XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_1 + XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_2 ...

This way compatibility is enshured for existing applications.

=== Parsing ===
The section decribes the EDID 1 parsing in Oyranos.

Oyranos parses EDID 1 information for monitor identification. It uses the
18 byte blocks starting from 54 for a monitor manufacturer, model and
serial ID string. In case the manufacturer was omitted, it switches back
to scan the 2 byte ID's starting at position 8. The later could be
extended to model(10) and serial(12).

=== Versions / Implementations ===
Oyranos 0.1.5 obtained the oyranos-monitor-nvidia commandline tool to demonstrate the described behaviour.

== ICC Profiles in X ==
=== References ===
* [[#Multi Monitor EDID in X11]]
* [[ICC Profiles in X Specification 0.2]]

=== Further Tasks ===
[[ICC_Profiles_in_X_Specification_0.3|(Draft for a ICC Profiles in X Specification 0.3)]]
* (done) possibly add a _ICC_IN_X_VERSION atom can be included to talk about the revision supported by the system
* (done) clarify about current(v0.2) ambiguities regarding monitor and screen counting starting from zero
* (done) clarify about current(v0.2) ambiguities regarding screens and pseudo - or Xinerama screens
* (done) Jon A. Cruz suggested to use monitor as a basic term instead of screen [http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/openicc/2007q4/001056.html]
* (done) Hal: substitute ''uncalibrated'' with ''uncharacterized'' to show that the vcgt issue is not targeted
* (done) set default for uncharacterised to sRGB [http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/openicc/2005q2/000431.html] 
* neutral hosting at fd.o see [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12824 bug #12824]

As soon as the discussion on the [[OpenICC]] list settles, revision 0.3 will be drafted and can be finally released after a small period.
