Oyranos has some requirements to provide colour management related informations through it's APIs.
For further reading see [[Monitor Configuration]].

== Multi Monitor EDID in X11 ==

EDID information describes monitor parameters like description, serial number and gives hints about colourimetric behaviour. 

Oyranos uses this information to identify a particular monitor and search for a best matching profile, as long as one is stored in the Oyranos device profile database.

=== Specification ===
X servers export the EDID inormation typically in the "XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA" and "XFree86_DDC_EDID2_RAWDATA" atom. If there are more monitors connected to the root window, the following atoms get a underscore and the monitor number appended, like in 

=== Example ===
Xinerama_screen_number = 0 => XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA

Xinerama_screen_number >= 1 => XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_1 + XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_2 ...

This way compatibility is enshured for existing applications.

* The issue was initially thrown to [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3910 the fd.o bugtracker].

=== Versions / Implementations ===
Oyranos 0.1.5 obtained the oyranos-monitor-nvidia commandline tool to demonstrate the described behaviour.

== ICC Profiles in X ==
=== References ===
* [[#Multi Monitor EDID in X11]]
* [[ICC Profiles in X Specification 0.2]]

=== Further Tasks ===
(for a v0.3)
* possibly add a _ICC_IN_X_VERSION atom can be included to talk about the revision supported by the system
* clarify about current(v0.2) ambiguities regarding monitor and screen counting starting from zero
* clarify about current(v0.2) ambiguities regarding screens and pseudo - or Xinerama screens
* Jon A. Cruz suggested to use monitor as a basic term instead of screen [http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/openicc/2007q4/001056.html]
* Hal: substitute ''uncalibrated'' with ''uncharacterized'' to show that the vcgt issue is not targeted
* neutral hosting at fd.o see [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12824 bug #12824]

As soon as the discussion on the [[OpenICC]] list settles, revision 0.3 will be drafted and can be finally released after a small period.
