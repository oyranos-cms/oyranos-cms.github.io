Oyranos has some requirements to provide colour management related informations through it's API.



== Multi Monitor EDID in X11 ==

EDID information describes monitor parameters like description, serial number and gives hints about colourimetric behaviour. 

Oyranos uses this information to identify a particular monitor and search for a best matching profile, as long as one is stored in the Oyranos device profile database.

=== Specification ===
X servers export the EDID inormation typically in the "XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA" and "XFree86_DDC_EDID2_RAWDATA" atom. If there are more monitors connected to the root window, the following atoms get a underscore and the screen number appended, like in 

=== Example ===
XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_[screen_number]  -> XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_1 XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_2 ...

This way compatibility is enshured for existing applications.

=== References ===
The issue was initially thrown to [https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3910].

=== Versions / Implementations ===
Oyranos 0.1.5 obtained the oyranos-monitor-nvidia commandline tool to demonstrate the described behaviour.
