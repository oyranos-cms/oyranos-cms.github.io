Oyranos has some requirements to provide colour management related informations through it's API.

== Multi Monitor EDID in X11 ==
EDID information describes monitor parameters like description, serial number and gives hints about colourimetric behaviour. 

Oyranos uses this information to identify a particular monitor and search for a best matching profile, as long as one is stored in the Oyranos device profile database.

X servers export the EDID inormation typically in the "XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA" atom. If there are more monitors connected to the root window, the following atoms get a underscore and the screen number appended, like in 

XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_[screen_number]  -> XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_1 XFree86_DDC_EDID1_RAWDATA_2 ...

This way compatibility is enshured for existing applications.
