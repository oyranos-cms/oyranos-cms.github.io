gnome-color-manager

Pros:
* well integrated into Gnome desktop
* provides profiling of several devices through ArgyllCMS in a nice UI

Contras:
* does not share its configuration across desktops, more workload for applications
* no policy concept in software from the author of the policykit, people are in need to configure each option separately
* the program exposes wrong terms, confusing diagrams and false claims, so it is very confusing to its audience
* very fat solution as it offers profiling as well, that part should better be split out
