== Introduction ==

This is a specification for associating ICC colour profiles with X monitors.
With this specification applications and services can obtain the appropriate
display profile for the monitor they are interessted in, and apply colour
correction to any images, which are being shown to the user.

== Specification ==

The _ICC_PROFILE base name contains the literal ICC colour profile. A atom with
name _ICC_PROFILE_IN_X_VERSION tells about awareness of the setting application
or service.

== _ICC_PROFILE ==

The atom name for the first monitor in a root window is _ICC_PROFILE.

For root windows spanning more than one monitor, as typical in Xinerama and XRandR
multihead configurations, a atom for each monitor is added holding the
appropriate ICC profile. The first monitor uses the _ICC_PROFILE atom name.
All monitors in a root window starting from
number one use _ICC_PROFILE as atom name extended with an underscore plus
the monitor number, e.g. _ICC_PROFILE_1 . Monitor counting starts with zero.
Thus a _ICC_PROFILE_0 atom should not appear. The counting follows the Xinerama API.

The atoms are of type <span class="type">XA_CARDINAL</span> with 8-bit
elements. The value of the atom should be a literal ICC profile, that
applications can read and parse directly.

This property does not have to be set on every monitor.  When this
property is not set for a monitor, this monitor is uncharacterised, and
colour correction for this monitor should be done using the sRGB colour space.

As profiles can be large, applications should read the profile for a
particular screen once, and cache it. As a screen's profile may change
during the lifetime of the process, applications should ask to receive
property change notifications from the root window, even if they don't
currently have a profile set. Applications which can change screens
using mechanisms such as display migration should be aware that the new
screen is likely to have different profiles assigned to monitors.

The meaning of the _ICC_PROFILE(_xxx) atom(s) is that of a target colour
space according to this version of the specification.

== _ICC_PROFILE_IN_X_VERSION ==

The _ICC_PROFILE_IN_X_VERSION atom specifies the version of this specification applied.
To simplify parsing the minor revision number is multiplied by 1 plus the major number by 100.
So for example revision 0.4 would result in:<br>
0*100 + 4*1 => 4 <br/>
The atom should be stored as ascii text of type <span class="type">XA_STRING</span>
with 8-bit elements.
